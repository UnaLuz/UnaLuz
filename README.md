# Hi there 👋 my name is Luz Cucarella

A Computer Programmer doing my best 😄

## 🙋‍♀️ About me

### 🌱 Learning

Currently I'm studying Computer Programming in a University in Argentina 🏫 but I'm also learning mobile development on my free time 📱

### 🕹️ Hobbies

I like a lot to play video games, on console or on my phone 🎮 but I'm just a casual player
